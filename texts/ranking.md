To keep attracting people's attention, CPANTS has been hosting an "online multiplayer game" where you can earn respect by uploading more Kwalitative distributions to CPAN.

As noted everywhere, Kwalitee is not quality. Higher Kwalitee score doesn't mean they are "best" or "good" Perl programmers. They are just good CPANTS game players who diligently improve their distributions as well as their tools for authoring, or maybe who can luckily use better tools from the first. So, don't take these rankings seriously. It's a game after all!
