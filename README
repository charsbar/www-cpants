WWW-CPANTS
==========

Yet another CPANTS frontend.

HOW TO USE
----------

1. Clone git://github.com/charsbar/www-cpants into somewhere.
2. Run "perl Makefile.PL" there and install dependencies.
3. Run "perl bin/configure.pl" to create a config file.
4. Run "prove -lwr t/" to make sure if it works.
5. Run "perl bin/run.pl --workers 3 --target backpan".
6. Run "plackup (or starman, etc) cpants.psgi".
7. Register bin/run.pl to your crontab.

I advise you not to "install" this into your Perl lib directories.
