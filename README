WWW-CPANTS
==========

Yet another CPANTS frontend.

HOW TO USE
----------

1. Clone git://github.com/cpants/www-cpants into somewhere.
2. Install dependencies by "cpanm --installdeps ." or "carton install"
3. Run "prove -lwr t/" to make sure if it works.
4. Run "perl bin/run_all --workers 3".
5. Run "plackup (or starman, etc) app.psgi".
6. Register bin/run_all to your crontab.

I advise you not to "install" this into your Perl lib directories.
