WWW-CPANTS

HOW TO USE

1. Clone git://github.com/charsbar/www-cpants into somewhere.
2. Run "perl Makefile.PL" there and install dependencies.
3. Run "perl bin/setup.pl" to setup databases and external libs.
4. Run "prove -l t/" to make sure if it works.
5. Run "perl bin/process_cpan.pl --cpan path/to/cpan/mirror".
6. Run "plackup (or starman, etc)".
7. Register process_cpan.pl to your crontab.

I advise you not to "install" this into your Perl lib directories.
